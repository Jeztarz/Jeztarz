I always strive to improve myself and love to
learn new things that I had never encountered
before. I also believe that my trait as a fast learner
will help me catch up with new technologies that
are constantly evolving.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Java
  - React js
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.
- ✔ Ask me about anything, I am happy to talk with everyone!😉<br>
- Outside tech, 📖 I love to read novels, 🖌️ do painting and skecthing, 🎵 listen to music, and 🌴 explore nature outdoors.
